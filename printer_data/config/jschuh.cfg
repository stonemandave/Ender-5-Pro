gcode: # This line is required by Klipper.
# Any code you put here will run at klipper startup, after the initialization
# for these macros. For example, you could uncomment the following line to
# automatically adjust your bed surface offsets to account for any changes made
# to your Z endstop or probe offset.
  ADJUST_SURFACE_OFFSETS

# This line includes all the standard macros.
#[include klipper-macros/*.cfg]
# Uncomment to include features that require specific hardware support.
# LCD menu support for features like bed surface selection and pause next layer.
#[include klipper-macros/optional/lcd_menus.cfg]
# Optimized bed leveling
#[include klipper-macros/optional/bed_mesh.cfg]

# The sections below here are required for the macros to work. If your config
# already has some of these sections you should merge the duplicates into one
# (or if they are identical just remove one of them).
